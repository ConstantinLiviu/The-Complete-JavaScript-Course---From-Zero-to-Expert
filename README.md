# The Complete JavaScript Course - From Zero to Expert

This repository showcases my work as I complete the following course: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/

Each chapter of the course gets its own folder which will contain a readme file and the completed tasks/projects/course concepts that are being taught.

The course focuses on Javascript, but in order to showcase my work I will also use HTML and CSS3 as well as any other technology that may be required
